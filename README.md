## 1. Amazon Bedrock

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed, fully serverless service offering access to foundation models from various AI companies in a single API, together with additional capabilities such as facilities for fine-tuning and agent frameworks.

Amazon Bedrock aims at simplifying development, especially for Generative AI, while maintaining privacy and security. Experimenting with foundation models is easy, and models can be further customized in a privacy-aware fashion
within Bedrock.

## 2. AstraDB

### 2.1 - Create your DataStax Astra account

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Account creation tutorial is available in [awesome astra](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-account/)


- `‚úÖ 2.1.a` -  _click the image below or go to [https://astra.datastax./com](bit.ly/3QxhO6t)_

<a href="bit.ly/3QxhO6t">
<img src="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/img/astra/astra-signin-github-0.png" />
</a>
<br/>

### 2.2 - Create a Vector Database

- `‚úÖ 2.2.a` - Find the create database button

![](./img/astra-01-create-db.png)

- `‚úÖ 2.2.b` - Populate the create db form

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Database Type  | Vector Database |
| Database Name  | `db_i_love_ai` |
| Keyspace Name  | `default_keyspace` |
| Cloud Provider  | `Amazon` |
| Region  | `us-east-2` |

- `‚úÖ 2.2.c` - Clock the `[Create Database]` button.

![](./img/astra-02-create-db.png)


### 2.3 - Create an Astra Token

Wait for for the database to change status from _pending_ to active _active_.

- `‚úÖ 2.3.a` - Select the connect TAB and click on Generate token

![](./img/astra-03-create-token.png)

- `‚úÖ 2.3.b` - Save the token for later as a json file

![](./img/astra-04-create-token.png)

The Token is in fact three separate strings: a `Client ID`, a `Client Secret` and the `token` proper. You will need some of these strings to access the database, depending on the type of access you plan. Although the Client ID, strictly speaking, is not a secret, you should regard this whole object as a secret and make sure not to share it inadvertently (e.g. committing it to a Git repository) as it grants access to your databases.

```json
{
  "ClientId": "ROkiiDZdvPOvHRSgoZtyAapp",
  "ClientSecret": "fakedfaked",
  "Token":"AstraCS:fake"
}
```

## 3. Retrieval Augmented generation

### 3.1 - Overview

In the following example, you will be able to run a standard RAG
(retrieval-augmented generation) application
that makes use of AI models from Amazon Bedrock and uses Astra DB as a Vector Store.

The integration is built with the LangChain framework, which conveniently offers
native support for Amazon Bedrock as well as Astra DB. Using LangChain is a popular
and well-established choice -- but certainly not the only one. See the references at
the end of the page for further options.

### 3.2 - Prerequisites

To run the integration demo notebook, you need:

- `‚úÖ` An **Amazon account** with access to Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker Studio. In particular, you will be asked to provide a set of credentials for programmatic access (i.e. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`);

- `‚úÖ` Alternatively, if you run the notebook from within SageMaker Studio, it is sufficient to add the Bedrock policy to your SageMaker role instead of explicitly providing the above secrets. Please refer to [this link](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-workshop#enable-aws-iam-permissions-for-bedrock) for details.

- `‚úÖ`  An **Astra account** with a **Serverless Cassandra with Vector Search** database. You will need the [Database ID](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/faq/#where-should-i-find-a-database-identifier) and an [Access Token](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-token/) with role "Database Administrator".

### 3.3 - Run the notebook

The integration example is a Python 3.8+ runnable notebook. The **suggested method** is to import the notebook in your **Amazon SageMaker Studio** and run it from there on a standardized environment, which also makes the necessary AWS access credentials readily available. _As a side note, however, the code can be executed on any environment able to run Python notebooks._

        <img src="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/img/bedrock/download_notebook_button.png"  style="width: 20%;" />
    </a>
</p>

- `‚úÖ 3.3.a` - Download the notebook from this repository at [this link](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/demo-astra-db-amazon-bedrock/raw/main/notebooks/bedrock.ipynb) and save it to your local computer.
(You can also view it [on your browser](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/demo-astra-db-amazon-bedrock/blob/main/notebooks/bedrock.ipynb).)

<img src="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/img/bedrock/screenshots/bedrock_open-sagemaker.png" />

- `‚úÖ 3.3.b` - Open your Amazon SageMaker console and click the "Studio" item in the left navbar. _Do not choose "Studio Lab", which is a different thing._

<img src="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/img/bedrock/screenshots/bedrock_open-studio.png" />

- `‚úÖ 3.3.c` - Click the "Open Studio" button after choosing a user profile: this will bring you to the Studio interface. _You may need to create a Studio instance ("SageMaker domain") if you don't have one already._

<img src="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/img/bedrock/screenshots/bedrock_upload.png" />

- `‚úÖ 3.3.d` - In the left toolbox of Sagemaker Studio, make sure you select the "File Browser" view and locate the "Upload" button: use it to upload the notebook file you previously saved. The notebook will be shown in the file browser.

<img src="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/img/bedrock/screenshots/bedrock_launch-notebook.png" />

- `‚úÖ 3.3.e` - If you double-click on it, the notebook will be opened in Studio. In order to run it, you will be asked to start a "notebook environment" (essentially, a Python runtime). Choose the "Data Science 3.0" image and a "Python 3" kernel and hit "Select".

<img src="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/img/bedrock/screenshots/bedrock_start-environment.png" />

- `‚úÖ 3.3.f` - Once the kernel has fully started, you can run each cell in sequence by clicking on them and pressing Shift+Enter. You will be asked for the secrets during execution.

### 3.4 - Check data in the database

```sql
use default_keyspace;
describe tables;
describe table shakespeare_act5;
```

```sql
clear
select count(*) from shakespeare_act5;
```

```
select row_id,attributes_blob,body_blob,metadata_s from shakespeare_act5 limit 3;
```

```
token@cqlsh:default_keyspace> select row_id,attributes_blob,body_blob,metadata_s from shakespeare_act5 limit 3;

 row_id                           | attributes_blob | body_blob                                                                                 | metadata_s
----------------------------------+-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------
 0c84e06ff2164b81842adb7d16205424 |            null |     Act 5, Scene 3, Line 211 : CAPULET : O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds! | {'act': '5', 'line': '211', 'scene': '3'}
 a507b2045dfa44c9868001e2ad70a967 |            null | Act 5, Scene 3, Line 189 : First Watchman : But the true ground of all these piteous woes | {'act': '5', 'line': '189', 'scene': '3'}
 63bf492797a745daa18a06d9c7de9de3 |            null |                 Act 5, Scene 3, Line 65 : ROMEO : For I come hither arm'd against myself: |  {'act': '5', 'line': '65', 'scene': '3'}

(3 rows)
token@cqlsh:default_keyspace> 
```


### 3.5 - Cleanup

During the above steps, some resources are created, which you may want to
cleanly dispose of after you are done.

These have been stared to run the notebook itself. You can shut them down from within SageMaker Studio:
select the "Running Terminals and Kernels" view on the left toolbar (see picture below) and click the "shut down" icon next to all instances, apps and sessions associated to the notebook you just ran.
